Hello everyone,

I’m excited to share our School Management System project. We aimed to reduce the time wasted on routine tasks and improve efficiency in schools. Here are key solutions we implemented:

Attendance: Created a quick form for teachers to take attendance in less than two minutes using a select list of student names. We’re also developing a Face Recognition system.

Discipline: Developed a form for teachers to report student violations instantly, which is automatically sent to the responsible officer for action.

Student History: Built a dynamic page for each student showing attendance, behavioral records, and achievements with a select date option.

Classroom Insights: Created bar charts for each grade to predict future performance and sent monthly reports on the most and least problematic students and classes.

We also ensured robust Security, Authentication, and Authorization measures, requiring principal approval for access to any data.
